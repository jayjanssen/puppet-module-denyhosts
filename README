Puppet module for managing denyhosts' (http://denyhosts.sf.net) configuration files.

--- Pawel J. Sawicki <pjs@pjs.name>


Usage: 

include denyhosts
include denyhosts::config



My iteration of this module has some tweaks to the denyhosts config, and one 
bugfix that affected me.

- Changed /etc/hosts.deny to 644.  It was 600 in the original version and that
caused issues for tcp-wrapper daemons not running as root.
- Purge denyhosts entries older than 1 week by default
- Skip purge on repeat offenders after 2 times on the bad list
- Block all services for offenders, not just sshd
- Sync with the denyhosts.net webservice
- Get offenders that have been trying for 5 hours or more

I may make more tweaks in the future, but this works for me, maybe it will 
work for you.
